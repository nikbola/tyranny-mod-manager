## Tyranny Mod Manager (WiP)

This is meant to be a combined mod manager and mod interface for the game Tyranny.
+ This is not a mod loader, it is just a manager. It is meant to be used in conjunction with [BepInEx for Tyranny](https://www.nexusmods.com/tyranny/mods/42)
+ My mod TMMCore (also WiP) enables runtime communication between the game and this mod manager. TMMCore is required for mod interfaces to work.

When doing the setup for the mod manager, it will automatically detect if BepInEx and TMMCore are installed.
+ If BepInEx is not installed, there will be a guide for how to install it in the software
+ TMMCore can be downloaded automatically through the manager, so you are not required to install this beforehand.
+ Note that TMMCore is not a requirement for the manager to work. It is only needed for the mods that utilize the in-application UI for mod settings.
